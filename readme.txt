PAD - Portable Audio Device

Modern C++ library for accessing audio devices. We plan to support WASAPI and ASIO on Windows 7 and newer and CoreAudio on OS-X. Support for the old MME sound system on Windows will not be included, therefore the library will not work on Windows XP. We have also decided that the code and the API is C++ (as far as possible), rather than C, to keep the API and code clean.
